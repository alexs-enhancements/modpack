  <p align="center">
    A 1.20.1 Fabric-based modpack for Minecraft focusing on performance, graphics, and quality of life enhancements
  </p>
</div>

Alex's Enhancements is a **quality of life modpack** dedicated to improving the game's performance and graphics, visuals, and overall experience. Originally crafted as my personal modpack, I decided to share it with the community due to the overwhelming interest. 

Alex's Enhancements offers a range of modern performance modifications, including Sodium, Lithium, Starlight, and many others. Additionally, it incorporates numerous tweaks designed to enhance the user experience. These include support for various Optifine features like zoom, connected textures, and shaders. Alex's Enhancements also addresses and fixes known bugs, introduces additional HUDs, and many other quality-of-life improvements.

## ‚öô Compatibility

Alex's Enhancements is able to run on almost any device, from high and low specifications.The pack is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Unfortunately in its current state Alex's Enhancements was only built for 1.20.1, but this is subject to change in the future.
