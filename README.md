Alex's Enhancements is a **quality of life modpack** dedicated to improving the game's performance, visuals, and overall experience. Originally crafted as my personal modpack, I decided to share it with the community due to the overwhelming interest.


## ‚öô Compatibility

Alex's Enhancements is able to run on almost any device, from high and low specifications.The pack is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Unfortunately in its current state Alex's Enhancements was only built for 1.20.1, but this is subject to change in the future.
